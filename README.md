# OBJECT_DETECTION_AND_TRACKING
This is an object detection and tracking project built using OpenCV. The project uses computer vision techniques to identify and track objects in real-time video streams.

The application is built using Python and OpenCV, two popular tools in the field of computer vision. The project showcases the power of OpenCV to detect objects of interest, track their movement, and label them in the video output.

The object detection and tracking algorithm used in this project is based on the popular Haar Cascade classifier. The classifier is trained using a dataset of positive and negative images to identify the features that distinguish the object of interest from the background. Once the classifier is trained, it is used to detect the object of interest in the video stream.

The tracking algorithm used in the project is based on the Kalman filter. The Kalman filter is a mathematical technique that can be used to estimate the state of a system based on noisy measurements. In the context of object tracking, the Kalman filter can be used to estimate the position and velocity of the object of interest based on the measurements obtained from the object detection algorithm.
